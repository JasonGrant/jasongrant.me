# Jason Grant - Personal Portfolio

Design executive and strategic builder focused on high-impact teams, product strategy, and design-driven leadership.

## About

This is my personal portfolio site built with Next.js and Once UI. I'm a systems-minded design executive who has built global design systems, led organizations through hypergrowth, and transformed how design collaborates across product and engineering.

## Experience

My path has taken me through agencies, startups, and public companies. I currently lead product design at Hi Marley, where I'm embedding design into the company's future.

## Writing

I share my thoughts on design leadership, team building, and strategic thinking through my writing. You can find my latest posts on this site and on my [Substack](https://mrjasongrant.substack.com/).
